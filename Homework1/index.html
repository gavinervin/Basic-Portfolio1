		<!--Short bio, nothing important here -->
			<p>My full name is Thomas Gavin Ervin, but I go by Gavin.  I was born in Picayune, MS and grew up outside of Jackson, MS.  After high school, I moved to North Carolina to attend Culinary school where I received a degree in restaurant managment.  I had a passion for cooking and loved the high pace of the restaurant industry.  After several years managing various kitches around the country, I decided it was time to go back to school and find a career with less stress and less physical demand.</p>

			<p> Shortly after moving back to NC for school, I met my amazing wife, Tracy.  We moved to Durham, NC in mid 2015 so I could complete my accounting degree at NC State, which I am currently finishing up.  I began the coding bootcamp to add a new skill to possibly mesh with my accounting knowledge, plus I have always loved all things computers and gaming.</p>
